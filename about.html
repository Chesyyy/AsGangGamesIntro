            <p>We at AsGang Games create ass games. The games have a goal of making you entertained. It's not our fault, the games aren't that well polished. It's about the idea, about the making of it. Never judge an AsGang Game by the cover, as behind it,  amazing games may be found. AsGang Games strives to innovate, and upgrade older titles. It is about showing new things, new mechanics, something that has never been seen before. With that said, we continue to work upon our releases, making them more fun with each update. <br><br> Remember: It's in the name. <br><br> Developer team: <br>- BrightestEmrald (Owner, Developer, Music producer) <br>- NekkoColon3 (Co-Owner, Developer, Music producer) <br>- General Radahn The Redmaned (Artist)<br>- ChilledKitten (Modeling)</p>
